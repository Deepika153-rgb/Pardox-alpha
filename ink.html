		<h4 class="display-4"> ABOUT US</h4>
		<p class="lead">Vanish is a Dutch brand of stain removing products, the manufacturer owned by the British company Reckitt Benckiser, sold in Australia, India, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Latin America, the United Kingdom and much of Europe. The product
			line is not related to the North American Vanish toilet cleaner brand owned by S. C. Johnson. Most Vanish products are designed for removing stains from clothing, with some for removing stains from carpets and upholstery. In Australia,
			Vanish has replaced 'Preen' in media advertising voiceovers as the name for the pre-treat clothing stain remover, although "Vanish Preen" and "Vanish Napisan" continue to appear as sub-brands. Vanish's marketing slogan, as of January 2011,
			is "Trust Pink, Forget Stains".<br>
			[2] VANISH is the global stain remover market leader in the Fabric treatment category, which is sold in more than 60 countries across the globe. VANISH started as a stain removing bar laundry product produced
			about 1983 by a small Scottish company called Projectina Co Ltd established by Robert G Macfarlane in Skelmorlie, Scotland. The brand was soon acquired by Ecolab in 1986 and became a Benckiser brand in 1987 when the latter acquired Ecolabâ€™s
			consumer goods operations. Benckiser N.V. merged with Reckitt & Colman PLC in 1999 to form Reckitt Benckiser PLC. The VANISH name is now applied to a wide range of stain removing products across a broad range of textile materials, now
			including curtains and carpets. The RB Group of companies (RB Group) has several subsidiary entities worldwide, such as RB N.V. based in the Netherlands, the entity that holds the trademarks for the VANISH brand.
